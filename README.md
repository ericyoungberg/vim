#Vim Config
_v2.2_

My Vim config.

Heavily inspired by [mutewinter's](https://github.com/mutewinter/dot_vim) **dot_vim** repo.

##Installation

1. `cd` into the *.vim* folder and then enter `./install`. Just press ENTER through each menu
2. Run the command `vim +PluginInstall` it did not run on its own
